*VimMail.txt*

This plugin is a small helper for writing mail from vim, I designed it using
mutt but it should work with other clients. I recommand to use it in
combination with [CheckAttach](https://github.com/chrisbra/CheckAttach).

Features                                                    *VimMail-features*

This plugin provides the following features

+ Contact completions using [pycarddav](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyCardDAV)
In insert mode, type:

    <LocalLeader>a

or

    <C-X><C-U>

It will search for the word under the cursor in your contact list.
If you are currently in a From,To,CC or Bcc line, only mail addresses will
be proposed, else all the match will appear.
More details will appear in the preview window including contact name, type
of the entry (mail, cell, phone etc.). To enable to preview window on
completion, add to your vimrc:

    set completeopt=preview

+ Quick launch for mail client in ReadOnly mode.

One of Mutt main drawbacks is that you can't access your mailbox while
writing mails, good news everyone, with vim-mail you can open mutt in R
mode easily by typing

    <LocalLeader>M

Moreover you can set the mail client command to your launcher script by
adding to your vimrc something like:

    let g:VimMailClient="/path/to/your/launcher"

+ Easy spelllang switch
While writting mails, I often need to do switch the spell lang which can be
annoying, so this plugin provide an easy way to do it.
Just type

    <LocalLeader>l

and the plugin will switch the spelllang using a list of allowed languages.
If the current spellang is the last allowed, it will disable spell, hit

    <LocalLeader>l

once more and you will restart with the first lang.
You can set the list of allowed langs in your vimrc:

    let g:VimSpellLangs=['fr', 'en', 'sp']

The default allowed langs are  french, english
This will work for any filetype as it can be usefull for many other kind of
files.
